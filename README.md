# Surface_Charging

This is how you do a full surface charging calculation for studying electro-catalytic systems. 
Please feel free to add any thing else to this repository related to this method.

THEORY:
Regular CHE approach : 
Under the CHE scheme, the chemical potential of an electronâˆ’proton pair can be approximated in reference to the free energy of half a dihydrogen molecule, and it also allows the effect of the applied potential and pH to be easily included in the model.

Surface charging: 
Under the CHE approach, the electrochemical potential is assumed to affect only the chemical potential of the exchanged electrons. Thus, electronic energy is independent with respect to the potential and is taken from neutral systems. However, the free energy for the sites and the intermediates in the "neutral" situation is not the same as the U = 0.0 V situation.


STEPS ( I take these steps to reduce the computational time for the calculation) :
